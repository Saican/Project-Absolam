/*
*	Project Absolam - Crosshair Weapon Utility
*
*	This class is to be inherited from in order for weapons added
*	by other mods to function with Project Absolam.
*
*	To use, inherit your weapon from PA_WeaponUtil, and set 
*	PA_WeaponUtil.ProjectileWeapon to true in your Default.
*	Then for a projectile ammo, supply the ammo class name
*	and the projectile class speed property.
*
*	Projectile Ammo Name - name of ammunition class inheriting from ammo
*	Projectile Speed - speed property of projectile class fired by weapon
*
*	^^^ Those should be 2 distinct classes you need information from ^^^
*
*	The ammo classes you define must be valid class names!
*	The crosshair does have validity checks so invalid classes are skipped.
*
*	You must still use the AmmoType1 and AmmoType2 properties when assigning
*	ammunitions to weapons.  The crosshair only checks those properties,
*	the properties supplied here are information only.
