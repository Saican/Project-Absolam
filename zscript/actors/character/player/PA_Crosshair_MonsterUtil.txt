/*
*	PA_MonsterUtil works basically the same as PA_WeaponUtil.
*	Monsters need to inherit from this class in order for the
*	TickSpeed property to be available.
*
*	What is TickSpeed?  Since monster speed is a combination
*	of their Speed property and number of calls to A_Chase,
*	the actual number of map units the monster will traverse
*	per tic can be calculated as S / D.
*	
*	S = speed property of the monster
*	D = frame duration of A_Chase
*
*	For example, the Arachnotron has a Speed of 12 and the
*	frame duration of each call to A_Chase is 3, which means
*	the TickSpeed is 4.
*
*	What about Fast Monsters?  This is a property multiplier,
*	iirc speed is simply doubled, which means the TickSpeed
*	will be as well, however that is handled by the crosshair
*	and only the base TickSpeed needs supplied.
